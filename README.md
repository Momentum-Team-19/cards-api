# Social Cards API

### What you can use this API to do

⚠️ Be sure to test that you have implemented permissions-checking correctly for these endpoints. For example, your API should not allow a user who is not the creator of a card to update that card.

- token login, logout, and register (i.e., create a new user)
- list all cards
- list all cards you've created (you, the logged in user)
- list all cards created by a user you follow
- show details of one card (with front and back messages)
- create a new card
- update a card you've made
- delete a card you've made
- follow another user
- unfollow another user
- block and unblock another user who follows you
- list all the users you follow
- list all the users who follow you
- A README with endpoints documented
